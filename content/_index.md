<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.dmi.unict.it">Department of Mathematics and Computer Science</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="http://unict.it">University of Catania</a>, where I am a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/">Image Processing Laboratory (IPLAB)</a>. </p>

<p>My expertise lies in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, my research investigates how intelligent systems can perceive, understand, and anticipate human actions and interactions directly from an embodied, egocentric viewpoint, to enable assistive technologies on wearable devices that provide direct support to users. See <a href="/research">this page</a> for selected research highlights and <a href="/publications">this page</a> for the full list of publications.</p></a>

<p>I teach a Bachelor course on <a href="https://antoninofurnari.github.io/fadlecturenotes/">Fundamentals of Data Analysis</a> and a Master Course on Deep Learning. I supervised more than 30 bachelor and master theses and supervised/currently supervising <a href="/people/">8 PhD students</a>.</p>
