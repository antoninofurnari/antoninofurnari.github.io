I am interested in developing algorithms and wearable systems based on egocentric vision to support users in their daily tasks, be them related to home/personal scenarios or work-related scenarios. I have been working on egocentric (or first-person) vision since the beginning of my PhD (2013) and developed experience on data collection and labeling, the definition of tasks, the development of algorithms, as well as their evaluation.
