# Fundamentals of Data Analysis
This page contains information on the Fundamentals of Data Analysis course, including the syllabus, lecture notes, and other resources.

The course has been updated through the years. Please find each year's details in the following.

<h3 style="margin-top:0">Changes in the academic year 2025/2026</h3>
<p>
In academic year 2025/2026, the syllabus and course have been completely revised to adapt the load for the transition of the course from the Master's Degree to the Bachelor's Degree.
The resulting course now focuses on core concepts without delving too much into details covered by other courses or more suited for Master's studies.
</p>

<h3>Structure of the course</h3>
<p>
The course includes a theory module (6 CFU) and a laboratory module (3 CFU). Theory sessions focus on core topics and algorithms, but also cover intuition and examples. Laboratory sessions focus on the solution of real data analysis problems using the Python language and related data science libraries through live coding sessions in the classroom.
</p>

<h3> Examination</h3>
<p>
The examination consists of a written exam and project in Python. Passing two in-itinere tests held during the course allows to be exempted from the written exam.
</p>

<h3>Data Science Challenge</h3>
<p>
At the end of the course, a challenge on data analysis will be organized. Students will have to solve a real data analysis project in 24/48 hours and present the results afterwards. The challenge can be tackled by small groups of 1-3 students. If the presentation is deemed to be sufficient, students are exempted from the project.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
High-quality, open-source notes will be provided during the course. For reference, consider last years' notes which can be found <a href="http://antoninofurnari.github.io/fadlecturenotes2425/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please consider that last years' notes are significantly more extensive than the ones intended for this year (and released lecture by lecture during the year) due to changes in the syllabus. Old notes will be always available for reference, but their content are not subject to examination. The student will instead refer to the current year's notes.
</p>
